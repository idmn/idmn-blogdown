This is a set of lectures aimed to introduce R to clinical SAS programmers.

Thousands and thousands of R packages have been developed, lots of books about R
have been written and lots of tutorials have been developed. So it's not that
there are not enough materials for learning R, more like the opposite. It can be
rather confusing for newcomers to understand where to start and what to focus
on. This course is not so much about developing strong R skills but rather about
outlining the most important aspects that clinical programmers should know about.
